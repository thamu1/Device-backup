SQL Tips:

Variables:
	SELECT  @msrp:=MAX(msrp) FROM products;

	SELECT productCode, productName, productLine, msrp
	FROM products
	WHERE msrp = @msrp;
	
	(or)
	
	select MAX(msrp) into @msrp FROM products;
	
	SELECT productCode, productName, productLine, msrp
	FROM products
	WHERE msrp = @msrp;
	
Compare successive row with in the same table:

	SELECT g1.item_no, g1.counted_date from_date,
		g2.counted_date to_date, (g2.qty - g1.qty) AS receipt_qty
	FROM inventory g1
	INNER JOIN inventory g2 ON g2.id = g1.id + 1
	WHERE g1.item_no = 'A';
	
row number generate:

	SET @row_number = 0; 
	SELECT 
		(@row_number:=@row_number + 1) AS num, 
		firstName, lastName
	FROM employees
	ORDER BY firstName, lastName LIMIT 5;
	
	
Generate random :

	SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY RAND() LIMIT 1;

get nth greatest value:

	SELECT 
		productCode, productName, buyPrice
	FROM
		products
	ORDER BY buyPrice DESC
	LIMIT 1 , 1;
	
Delete duplicate value:
	DELETE t1 FROM contacts t1
	INNER JOIN contacts t2 
	WHERE 
		t1.id < t2.id AND 
		t1.email = t2.email;
		
Find count between two object: (b a a b)
	select *
	from (
	select *,
	case when predate<> prebytype 
		then (select rnk from 
			(select id,rnk,ordate from 
				(select acid,id, rnk, ordate 
					from vw_coun where type = t1.type and acid = t1.acid and ordate < t1.ordate
					group by acid,id,ordate ) as st1
					) as st2 )
		else 0
		end as re1
	from( select * from vw_coun)t1
	) t2
	
Group_concat Sorting:

	SELECT email_domain, 
	array_to_string(ARRAY_AGG(global_member_token ORDER BY global_member_token),',') AS gmt
	FROM `dev-gold-core.it_online_auxiliary.gmt_attributes`
	GROUP BY email_domain limit 10;
	
Update string column into datetime:

	SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 1;
	
	update world.order set ship_date = 
	DATE_FORMAT(STR_TO_DATE(shipping_limit_date, '%d-%m-%Y %H.%i'), 
	'%Y-%m-%d') ;
